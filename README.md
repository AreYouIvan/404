# 404 Not Found Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://areyouivan.github.io/404/).

## Used Tools

In the project directory, I've used:

### `React`

React was the framework that I used with its CLI (Create-React-App).\

This was so useful because I've never used a Framework in a personal Project.\

I've used the methodologies of components and all the arrengement settled.\

### `Travis CI`

To install all these dependencies I've used Travis, this tool have been so useful to add all the implementations on the deployments.\

### `CSS`

Since I've needed layout, I've done with CSS knowledge and aplying a few of **CSS-in-JS**.\

### `GH-Pages`

This project was published on GH-Pages, so I've needed to set some modifications to Pages. It have been a challenge but I've did it luckly.
